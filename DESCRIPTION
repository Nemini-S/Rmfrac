Title: Simulation and Statistical Analysis of Multifractional Processes
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Simulation of several fractional and multifractional processes. Includes Brownian and fractional Brownian motions, bridges and Gaussian Haar-based multifractional processes. Estimation of Hurst functions and local fractal dimension. Clustering realisations based on the Hurst functions. Several functions to estimate and plot geometric statistics of the processes and time series. Shiny application for interactive use of the functions from the package.
