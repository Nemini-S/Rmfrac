\title{Estimation of the local fractal dimension}
\usage{
LFD(X, N = 100, Q = 2, L = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Data frame where the first column is a numeric time sequence and the second is the values of the multifractional process.}

\item{N}{The same argument that is used for the estimation of Hurst function. Number of sub-intervals on which the estimation is performed on. Default is set to 100 sub-intervals.}

\item{Q}{The same argument that is used for the estimation of Hurst function. Fixed integer greater than or equal to 2. Default is set to 2.}

\item{L}{The same argument that is used for the estimation of Hurst function. Fixed integer greater than or equal to 2. Default is set to 2.}
}
\value{
A data frame where the first column is a time sequence and the second column is estimated values of the local fractal dimension.
}
\description{
This function computes the estimates for the local fractal dimension.
}
\details{
The formula \eqn{\widehat{LFD} = 2-\widehat{H}(t)} is used to compute the estimated local fractal dimension,
where \eqn{\widehat{H}(t)} is the estimated Hurst function.
}
\note{
Since these are estimators of local characteristics, reliable results can only be obtained when a sufficiently large number of points is used.

#LFD of a multifractional process simulated using GHBMP function
T <- seq(0,1,by=(1/2)^10)
H <- function(t) {return(0.5-0.4*sin(6*3.14*t))}

#LFD of a fractional Browian motion simulated using FBm
X<-FBm(H=0.5,x_start=0,t_start=0,t_end=2,N=1000)
