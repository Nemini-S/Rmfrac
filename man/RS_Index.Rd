\title{Relative strength index}
\usage{
RS_Index(
  X,
  period = 14,
  plot = getOption("Rmfrac.plot", FALSE),
  overbought = 70,
  oversold = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A vector.}

\item{period}{Period length used for smoothing. Default is set to 14.}

\item{plot}{Logical: If \code{TRUE}, the time series and the
RSI are plotted in the same window.}

\item{overbought}{Horizontal line which indicates an overbought level in the RSI plot. Default is set to 70.}

\item{oversold}{Horizontal line which indicates an oversold level in the RSI plot. Default is set to 30.}
}
\value{
A list, vector or \code{xts} object of the RSI values. If \code{plot=TRUE},
the time series and the RSI with \code{overbought} and
\code{oversold} levels are plotted.
}
\description{
This function computes the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for a time series.
}
\details{
To compute the RSI,

\deqn{\text{RSI} = 100 \dfrac{\text{Average\_gain}}{\text{Average\_gain}+\text{Average\_loss}}}

formula is used. Average gain and average loss are computed using the Wilders's smoothing method.
