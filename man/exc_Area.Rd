\title{Excursion area}
\usage{
exc_Area(X, A, N = 10000, level = "greater", subI = NULL, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Data frame where the first column is a numeric time sequence \eqn{t}
and the second one is the values of the time series \eqn{X(t)}.}

\item{A}{Constant level as a numeric value.}

\item{N}{Number of steps on the time interval (or time sub-interval) used for computations. Default set to 10000.}

\item{level}{A vector of character strings which specifies whether the excursion
area is required for \code{X}, \code{"greater"} or \code{"lower"} than \code{A}. Default set to \code{"greater"}.}

\item{subI}{Time sub-interval is a vector, where the lower bound is
the first element and the upper bound is the second. Optional: If provided, the excursion area
for the sub-interval is returned, otherwise the whole time interval is considered.}

\item{plot}{Logical: If \code{TRUE}, the time series, constant level and excursion area are plotted.}
}
\value{
Excursion area. If \code{plot=TRUE}, the time series, the constant level and excursion area
are plotted.
}
\description{
Computes the excursion area where a time series \eqn{X(t)} is greater or lower than the
constant level \code{A} for the provided time interval or its sub-interval.
}
\examples{
t <- seq(0, 1, length =1 000)
TS <- data.frame("t" = t, "X(t)" = rnorm(1000))
exc_Area(TS, 0.8, level = 'lower', subI = c(0.5,0.8), plot = TRUE)
