\title{Estimated sojourn measure}
\usage{
sojourn(X, A, N = 10000, level = "greater", subI = NULL, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Data frame where the first column is a time sequence \eqn{t}
and the second one is the values of the time series \eqn{X(t)}.}

\item{A}{Constant level as a numeric value.}

\item{N}{Number of steps the time interval (or time sub-interval) is split into. Default set to 10000.}

\item{level}{A vector of character strings which specifies which sojourn
measure required for \code{X}, \code{"greater"} or \code{"lower"} than \code{A}. Default set to \code{"greater"}.}

\item{subI}{Time sub-interval is a vector, where the lower bound is
the first element and the upper bound is the second. Optional: If provided,
the estimated sojourn measure for the sub-interval is returned, otherwise the whole time interval is considered.}

\item{plot}{Logical: If \code{TRUE}, the time series, constant level and the sojourn measure are plotted.}
}
\value{
Estimated sojourn measure. If \code{plot=TRUE}, the time series, the constant level (in blue) and the excursion region (in red) are plotted.
}
\description{
Computes the estimated sojourn measure for a time series \eqn{X(t)} greater or lower than the
constant level \code{A} for the provided time interval or its sub-interval.
}
\examples{
t <- seq(0,1,length=1000)
TS <- data.frame("t"=t,"X(t)"=rnorm(1000))
sojourn(TS,0.8,level='lower',subI=c(0.5,0.8),plot=TRUE)
